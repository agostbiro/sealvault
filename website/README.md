# SealVault Website

## Overview

URL: [https://sealvault.org](https://sealvault.org)

Provides landing page and features for end users, developer documentation for
SealVault developers and the SealVault blog. 

Powered by [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Development

The landing page and the blog depend on paid features from [Mkdocs Material
Insiders](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/), but you can
work on the developer documentation without these by installing the free version
as documented
[here.](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)
